# GBF_Gacha_API_2

##Description

API of Grandblue Fantasy summons created using Node.js and MongoDB. Created since the dastabase consists of single objects that have no relation to each other. Serves as the second of two possible back ends for https://github.com/NickyLiu91/GBF-Gacha-Simulator/blob/master/README.md, which is a summon simulator for the game.
